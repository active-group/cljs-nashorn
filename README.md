# cljs-nashorn

Provides a ClojureScript REPL running on Oracle's Nashorn Javascript
engine.

## Requirements

In order to run the Nashorn engine, you need a recent Java 8 runtime.
This code was originally developed using version 1.8.0-ea-b75. It
would be advisable to ensure you have at least this version installed.

### Getting Java 8

Java 8 packages for various operating systems can be downloaded from
[Oracle's JDK8 download site](http://jdk8.java.net/download.html).

### Installing Java 8 on Ubuntu

At the time of writing, this is the easiest way to install a
sufficiently recent Java 8 runtime on the Ubuntu GNU/Linux OS:

```sh
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```

## Leiningen Plugin

To setup the Leiningen plugin, add this to your `project.clj` or `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
:plugins [[org.bodil/lein-nashorn "0.1.1"]]
```

Then, start the REPL like this:

```sh
$ lein trampoline nasrepl
```

## In-Project Usage

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
[org.bodil/cljs-nashorn "0.1.1"]
```

To launch the REPL the hard way, run `lein repl` and enter the following:

```clojure
(require '[cljs.repl :as repl] '[cljs.repl.nashorn :as nashorn])
(repl/repl (nashorn/repl-env))
```
